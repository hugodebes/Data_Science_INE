# Data_Science_INE
I have completed all notebooks of the free parts of the INE certification regarding Data Science. 

You'll find the different notebooks I have completed throughout this 6 hours course.

Here are some visual examples :

## Visualization
This showcases the basis of different Python libraries such as NumPy or Pandas concerning data processing and visualizations.
