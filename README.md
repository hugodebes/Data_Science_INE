# Data_Science_INE

I have completed all the free parts of the INE certification regarding Data Science. 

You'll find the different notebooks I have completed throughout this 6 hours course.

This showcases the basis of different Python libraries such as NumPy or Pandas.

Then, we create a real-world problem using the Scikit Learn libraries. It contains a simple utilization of different models like the Linear Regression or a Random Tree Classifier.

It was a good insight as it was my first time using this library whom I have found very intuitive.

Thanks to the INE teams for this great course. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
